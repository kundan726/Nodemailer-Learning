#Project: Email Automation with Nodemailer and File Storage

This project aims to gain practical experience with Node.js in two key areas:

1. Email Automation:

Utilize the nodemailer library to send emails programmatically from a Node.js application.
Understand configuration options, recipient handling, attachments, and error handling.
Explore potential use cases for automated email sending in various scenarios.
2. File Storage:

Implement file upload functionality using disk storage on the local system.
Learn file handling techniques like saving, reading, and directory management.
Integrate with Amazon S3 storage service for cloud-based file storage and scaling.
Understand S3 configuration and security best practices for uploading and retrieving files.
Project Objectives:

Develop a functional application that can send emails with attachments (optional).
Demonstrate proficiency in using nodemailer and handling file operations.
Gain hands-on experience with local and cloud-based storage options.
Understand security considerations and best practices for both aspects.
Target Audience:

This project is designed for individuals with basic Node.js knowledge who want to delve deeper into advanced functionalities like email automation and file storage.

Deliverables:

A fully functional Node.js application showcasing email sending and file storage capabilities.
Documentation outlining the project setup, implementation details, and key learning points.
Potential enhancements and future development possibilities.
Expected Duration:

The project duration depends on individual skill level and the desired scope of functionality. A basic prototype could be completed within a few days, while advanced features may require more time.

Next Steps:
